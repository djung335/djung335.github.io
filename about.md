Hi there! I'm Daniel Jung- a first-year undergrad at Northeastern University.

I'm currently studying computer science with a software concentration as well as a minor in mathematics.

I'm also interested in machine learning, web development, and data science.

Outside of the classroom, I like to play piano and guitar. I also enjoy playing badminton and volleyball.
