Hi there! I'm Daniel Jung- a first-year undergrad at Northeastern University.

I'm currently studying computer science with a software concentration as well as a minor in mathematics.

I'm also interested in machine learning, web development, and data science.

Outside of school, I like to play badminton, spikeball, and volleyball. I also enjoy playing piano and guitar (check out my instagram feed).

This website exists for me to share my thoughts on anything that comes to mind, from the best poptart flavors to advice for students at my school.
