title: Reflections After Freshman Year Of College
---

Welcome to blog post #1! In this one, I plan to talk a bit about what I've learned about after freshman year of university during COVID-19.

By the time this post comes out, I will have finished all my finals. After what seems like an extremely exhausting year, I want to share a few experiences I've gained. Although my initial college experience will be slightly different than others due to COVID-19, I still hope you can find something helpful out of this.
